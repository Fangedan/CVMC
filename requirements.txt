"""
Project Dependencies File
-------------------------
This file lists the required Python packages for a **multimodal deep learning project** 
that processes **audio and visual data**. The listed dependencies support deep learning, 
machine learning, data processing, and model evaluation.

Required Packages:
1. **Deep Learning & PyTorch**
   - `torch`: Core PyTorch library for building and training neural networks.
   - `torchaudio`: Audio processing utilities for PyTorch.
   - `torchvision`: Tools for processing image data, including datasets and pre-trained models.

2. **Scientific Computing & Machine Learning**
   - `numpy`: Numerical computations and large array manipulations.
   - `scipy`: Scientific computing tools, including signal processing.
   - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.

3. **Audiovisual Processing**
   - `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for image and video processing.
   - `python_speech_features`: Extracts speech features such as **MFCCs, filter banks, and spectrograms**.

4. **Data Handling & Progress Tracking**
   - `tqdm`: Displays progress bars for long-running operations (e.g., training loops).
   - `tensorboard`: Monitors training metrics like loss, accuracy, and performance over time.

5. **External Data Downloading**
   - `youtube-dl`: Downloads videos from YouTube and other sources (useful for dataset creation).

Usage:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if stored in a requirements file).
- These libraries support a **deep learning model** that combines **audio and visual data** for tasks like 
  **speech recognition, lip-reading, or video classification**.
